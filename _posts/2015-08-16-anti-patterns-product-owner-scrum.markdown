## Product Owner Smells in Scrum

## Scrum, les mauvaises odeurs chez les product owners

During whole my professional life, people spent hours telling me the importance of good design patterns. I believe all of us bought books about design partners, cookbook recipes or any other type of book that would give you the good practices of the industry. I do not have anything against that and how could I? Myself wrote a book about Agile Retrospectives tools box :). All these books are useful and necessary but during my career I understood that writing about good practices is not enough. We must write about what we should not do, the anti-patterns, the smells like I call them.

Durant toute ma vie professionnelle, les gens m'ont parlé pendant des heures de l'importance des bons patterns de conception. Je crois que nous avons tous acheté des livres sur les patterns de conceptions, les recettes de cuisines ou toutes autres types d'ouvrages nous donnant les bonnes pratiques dans tel ou tel domaine. Je n'ai rien contre ça et comment le pourrais-je ? J'ai moi-même écrit un livre boîte-à-outils pour les rétrospectives agiles :). Tous ces ouvrages sont utiles et nécessaires mais pendant ma carrière j'ai compris qu'écrire sur les bonnes pratiques n'est pas suffisant. Nous devons écrire ce que nous ne devrions pas faire, les anti patterns, les mauvaises odeurs comme je les appelle.

During the next few weeks I will be spending some time writing about this topic. I will be writing several blog posts about the smells of different roles in Scrum and about different errors that companies usually do when we implement scrum. I will start this series with Product Owner smells. I already wrote some of the common problems with Product Owners within organisations and that work can be found [here](http://lmsgoncalves.com/2013/02/27/common-mistakes/), but today I am going to add more issues to that [list](http://lmsgoncalves.com/tag/anti-pattern/). If you are interested in “Anti-Patterns” click here, you will find all my blog posts touching on this topic.

Pendant les prochaines semaines, je passerai un peu de temps à écrire sur ce sujet. J'écrirai plusieurs articles de blog sur les mauvaises odeurs des différents rôles dans Scrum et sur les différentes erreurs que font habituellement les entreprises lorsqu'elles implémentent scrum. Je commencerai cette série sur les mauvaises odeurs des product owners. J'ai déjà écrit sur les problèmes arrivant d'ordinaire aux product owners dans les organisations, ce travail peut être consulté [ici](http://lmsgoncalves.com/2013/02/27/common-mistakes/), mais aujourd'hui je vais ajouter de nouveaux problèmes à cette liste.. Si vous êtes intéressés par les anti patterns, cliquez [ici](http://lmsgoncalves.com/tag/anti-pattern/), vous y trouverez tous les articles de mon blog sur ce sujet.

### No single Product Owner for one team

### Le product owner n'est pas seul pour une équipe

I see this phenomenon happening quite often in organisations that implemented SAFe (Scaling Agile Framework) in the past, dropped and returned to simple Scrum. In the SAFe framework you have two roles: Product Manager and Product Owner. The Product Manager is the one thinking more in a strategically way, the Product Owner is the one thinking more on the daily activities.

J'ai vu ce phénomène assez souvent dans les organisations qui ont implémenté SAFe (Scaling Agile Framework) par le passé, qui l'ont abandonné et sont revenus simplement vers Scrum. Dans le cadre SAFe, il y a deux rôles : le product manager et le product owner. Le product manager est celui qui pense davantage en terme stratégique, le product owner est celui qui est plus dans les activités quotidiennes. 

When companies go back to Scrum there is no more two roles, there is only Product Owner but companies do not want to fire anyone so they assign two product owners to the team, even if they still use the same mind set: assigning one person to the strategically part and another to the daily activities I see this as a failure.

Quand les entreprises reviennent vers Scrum, les deux rôles n'existent plus, seul existe le product owner mais les entreprises ne veulent licencier personne donc elles affectent deux product owners à l'équipe même si elles continuent d'agir comme précédemment : une personne est affectée à la stratégie et l'autre aux activités quotidiennes, je vois ceci comme un échec.

I believe its extremely difficult to work with this scenario, you must have one single person responsible for the whole product, like a friend of mine used to say “one single neck”.

Je crois qu'il est extrêmement difficile de travailler dans ce scénario, vous devez avoir une seule personne pour l'ensemble du produit, comme l'un de mes amis a l'habitude de dire "un seul cou" (ou une seule tête, si vous préférez - NdT).

#### Solution:

#### Solution :

Companies must understand that is not possible to have this scenario and they must provide an environment where each team has one single product owner.

Les entreprises doivent comprendre qu'il n'est pas possible d'avoir ce scénario et qu'elles doivent offrir un environnement dans lequel chaque équipe a un seul product owner.

### Interference with the daily work

### Interférence dans le travail quotidien

I saw this happening in several organisations but mainly because of two big causes. First cause the Product Owner in his past was a typical project manager where he was chasing people in order to get job done. Second cause relies on the fact the scrum master is not strong and the Product Owner must step into and do a lot of the activities of the scrum master, taking the role to serious ending up controlling and interfering more than helping.

J'ai pu observer dans plusieurs organisations et principalement pour deux raisons. La première est que le product owner était par le passé le chef de projet typique qui courait après les gens pour que le boulot soit fait. La deuxième cause repose sur le fait que le scrum master ne soit pas fort et que le product owner doit intervenir et faire une grande partie des activités du scrum master, qu'il finisse par prendre le rôle trop au sérieux pour finir par contrôler et interférer plutôt qu'aider.

In this situation is normal to see Product Owners taking a quite active role on the dailies, manipulating the normal process. Another problem that I see quite often relies on the fact of Product Owners track what developers are doing,I saw several examples of Product Owners talking directly with developers asking what they are doing because his name is not assign to any task. Now imagine how developers felt when suffering this kind of control.

Dans cette situation, il est normal de voir les product owners prendre un rôle assez actif au quotidien, manipulant le processus normal. Un autre problème que je vois assez souvent est que les product owners tracent ce que font les développeurs, j'ai vu plusieurs fois des product owners parler à des développeurs et leurs demandant ce qu'ils étaient en train de faire parce qu'aucune tâche n'était associée à leur nom. Maintenant imaginez ce que les développeurs ressentent lorsqu'ils subissent ce type de contrôle.

#### Solution:

#### Solution :

I believe the solution for this case is to find a strong and experienced Scrum Master. An experienced Scrum Master understands quite well both roles (Scrum Master and Product Owner) and can coach the Product Owner to allow the team to take responsibility of their own tasks. One of the roles of Scrum Masters is to protect the team from intrusions, having a strong and experience strong master within the team will allow the team to remain isolated and protected from un wanted interferences, and at the same time will allow Product Owners to be coached on right behaviours.

Je crois que la solution dans ce cas est de trouver un scrum master fort et expérimenté. Un scrum master expérimenté comprend assez bien ces deux rôles (scrum master et product owner) et il peut tutorer le product owner pour permettre à l'équipe de prendre la responsabilité de ses propres tâches L'un des rôles des scrum masters est de protéger l'équipe des intrusions, avoir un scrum master fort et expérimenter à l'intérieur de l'équipe permettra à celle-ci de rester isolée et protégée des interférences non désirées, et en même temps d'aider les product owners a avoir les bons comportements.  

### Stories built around product layers

### Des stories construites autour de couches produit

This is a tricky topic. Over the last months I have been working with teams that cannot deliver as fast as they could if they would use other approaches. They made a quite typical mistake, they have user stories that are built around layers of the product. As an outcome user stories are dependent on each others causing a lot of delays to deliver a product that can be usable by the customer.

C'est un sujet épineux. Au cours des derniers mois, j'ai travaillé avec des équipes qui n'étaient pas en capacité de livrer aussi vite qu'elles l'auraient fait si elles avaient utilisé d'autres approches. Elles font certaines des erreurs ordinaires, elles ont des user stories construites autour des couches produit. Ceci a comme résultat que les user stories sont dépendantes les unes des autres retardant d'autant la mise à disposition d'un produit utilisable par un client.

#### Solution:

#### Solution :

In general a good user story should be written covering all the layers of the product. Should be an end to end user story. The solution for this problem is coach the Product Owner and the team about this. For me works quite well when I explain to developers that does not matter if we deliver 200 back end user stories when in reality the customer cannot use them without the front end part. Below there is a picture from Ángel Medinilla that shows in a great way how stories should be built.

En général, une bonne user story devrait être écrite couvrant toutes les couches du produit. Cela devrait la finalité d'une user story pour utilisateur final. La solution à ce problème est de tutorer l'équipe et le product owner sur ce sujet. J'arrive à bien à le faire comprendre lorsque j'explique aux développeurs que cela ne sert à rien si nous livrons 200 user story backend si l'utilisateur ne peut pas les utiliser sans la partie frontend. Ci-dessous une image d'Ángel Medinilla montrant de manière flagrante comment les stories devraient être construite.

### No projection of the product backlog

### Pas de projection du product backlog

Usually the Scrum Master produces burn down charts showing how the sprint went. This is quite common, what is not so common is the Release/Program burn down or burn up. This is a quite common problem in many of the organisations where I worked for. Not having this kind of information make the life of product owner harder because it gets harder to know if the team is on track or not.

Généralement le scrum master réalise des burn down charts montrant comment se déroule le sprint. C'est une pratique assez répandu, ce qui est moins répandu est le burn up ou le burn down de livraison ou du produit . C'est un problème assez répandu dans beaucoup d'organisations dans lesquelles j'ai pu travailler. Ne pas avoir ce type d'informations rend la vie du product owner plus difficile parce qu'il est plus difficile de savoir si l'équipe est dans les clous ou pas.

With this kind of information available the product owner can take better decisions about scope in order to deliver the product on time, bringing the biggest amount of value to the customer.

Avec ce type d'informations disponible le product owner peut prendre de meilleures décisions concernant le périmètre afin de livrer le produit dans les temps, et apporter le montant de valeur le plus grand possible au client.

#### Solution:

#### Solution :

The solution here is quite easy. The product owner should build a product burn down/burn up exactly like the scrum master does, but instead of being focused on the sprint, the product owner focus on the release. A possible example can be observed below.

La solution ici est assez facile. Le product owner devrait construire un burn down/burn up de produit exactement comme le scrum master le fait, mais à la place d'être focalisé sur le sprint, le product owner devra se focaliser sur la livraison. Un exemple de ce que cela peut donner peut être observé ci-dessous.

### Burnup

### Burnup

Backlog is filled with a bunch of "Strings" not proper user stories

Le backlog est rempli de tout un galimatias et non d'user stories en bonne et due forme.

This problem is by far one of the most commons that I observed during the last years. Most of the times the product owner does not write the stories in a proper format, he just write few key words and that´s it. The problem with this approach relies on the fact that everyone outside of Product Owner head will not understand what the user story is about. And to be honest I saw some examples where not even the product owner knew what he wanted to solve with some of the user stories that he wrote.

Ce problème est de loin le plus répandu de ceux que j'ai pu observé ces dernières années. La plupart du temps, le product owner n'écrit pas les stories dans un format utilisable, il écrit juste quelques mots et c'est tout. Le problème avec cette approche repose sur le fait que tout le monde en dehors du product owner ne pourra pas comprendre de quoi parle la user story. Pour être honnête, j'ai vu des exemples de stories dans lesquelles même le product owner ne savait plus ce qu'il voulait solutionner avec certaines des users stories qu'il avait écrite.

#### Solution:

#### Solution :

In order to point out to the solution I am using a blog post from Roman Pichler. “[10 Tips to write good user stories](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/)“.

Rendons à César ce qui est à César, j'utilise comme solution un article de Roman Pichler : "[10 astuces pour écrire de bonnes user stories](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/)".

### The Product Owner is underpowered and does not act as the guard of the backlog

### Le product owner est dans l'incapacité de faire quoi que ce soit et n'agit pas en tant que gardien du backlog.

I saw this situation happening in some of the companies where I worked. Unfortunately, companies do not realise how dangerous this is. In these companies the product owner did not have power to decide anything and managers could change the backlog as much as they wanted.

J'ai vu cette situation dans certaines des entreprises pour lesquelles j'ai travaillé. Malheureusement, ces entreprises ne réalisent pas à quel point cela est dangereux. Dans ces entreprises, le product owner n'avait pas le pouvoir de décider quoi que ce soit et les responsables pouvaient changer le backlog autant qu'ils le voulaient.

This situation leads the Product Owners to no longer care about the product. They started to not care with the ROI, and they completely lost all their entrepreneurial behaviour.

Cette situation conduit les product owners à ne plus s'occuper du produit. Ils commencent à ne plus se soucier du ROI, et ils perdent complètement leur comportement d'entrepreneur. 

Usually this happens with traditional management, where they want to control everything that is part of the Product Backlog, not giving any freedom or trust to the Product Owner.

Cela se produit généralement dans un environnement de management traditionnel, où les entreprises veulent contrôler tout les éléments du product backlog, ni ne donner aucune liberté ni ne faire confiance au product owner.

#### Solution:

#### Solution :

My experience tells me this situation is quite difficult to resolve, because most of the time this problem comes from managers above the Product Owner.

Mon expérience me dit que cette situation est assez difficile à résoudre, principalement parce que la plupart du temps le problème vient des responsables au-dessus du product owner.

In this case, the Scrum Master or the Agile Coach has a fundamental role to play. He is responsible for talking with the management (or with anyone else who is behaving in this way) and explaining how this behaviour has an impact on the company and the quality of the product.

Dans ce cas, le scrum master ou le coach agile ont un rôle fondamental à jouer. Il est responsable pour parler avec l'encadrement (ou avec quiconque ayant cette façon de se comporter.) et pour expliquer l'impact que peut avoir ce comportement sur la compagnie et sur la qualité du produit.

I have witnessed several situations where the Agile Coach was able to explain to Senior Management what was happening and was able to help management to change their behaviour.

J'ai été témoin de plusieurs situations dans lesquelles le coach agile était capable d'expliquer à la direction ce qu'il était en train de se passer et qui était capable d'aider l'encadrement à changer de comportement.

### The Product Owner that uses estimates to set deadline demos for clients

### Le product owner qui utilise des estimations pour fixer des dates butoirs des démos pour les clients

Here we have a typical problem that is common in people who do not understand the basics of software development. This is much deeper than Agile software development. The people who do this do not understand how software development works, so their estimates are just an approximate calculation; they do not guarantee that everything will be done by a certain date.

Ici nous avons un problème typique qui est rencontré habituellement chez les personnes qui ne comprennent pas les bases du développement logiciel. Cela va au-delà du développement agile de logiciel. Les personnes qui font cela ne comprennent pas comment le développement logiciel fonctionne, et donc leurs estimations ne sont que des calculs approximatifs ; elles ne garantissent en rien que tout sera fait pour une certaine date. 

#### Solution:

#### Solution :

A lot of people approach me telling me that sometimes we do not choose the release dates and we have deadlines to be met. Therefore, there is no way to behave in a different manner in this kind of setup, the customers just want to have their product.

Un certain nombre de personnes m'approchent en me disant que quelques fois nous ne choisissons pas les dates de livraisons et que nous avons des dates butoirs à respecter. Par conséquent, 

For those who do not know me, I worked for a huge mobile manufacturing company for years, so I understand what dates set by the market means. Every year we had Christmas sales where the phones needed to be out; there was no other solution, so how could we manage this? The answer is simple: follow basic agile principles.

The Product Owner must educate the client that after every sprint the team has got something to show (with this the Product Owner gets his demos). During the sprint demo/review the client has the opportunity to provide feedback on what was delivered, and more importantly, has the opportunity to select the most important things that are on the backlog, enabling the team to always deliver the most value to the client.

At the same time (and this is one of the most frequently forgotten practices), the Product Owner checks the overall release status using Releases Burn Downs. This practice allows the Product Owner to know exactly where the team will land, and start a discussion with the client about what can be dropped in the event the team is not able to deliver on time.

If the client is not open to all these suggestions, the company should start to reconsider if the client is someone with whom the company would like to work in the future. The problems that will arise from future interactions will be so complex that the relationship will not benefit any of the parties.

 

### The Product Owner is too busy for the team, he has too many teams

I see this problem too often, Product Owners who are completely overloaded with work: the overworked Product Owner.

#### Solution:

A product owner should not have more than two teams. Of course, this is a general rule and it might be possible to have more, but if he/she has more than that, it can be difficult to give full support to the teams.

The Product Owner is too busy for the team, he spends a lot of time in meetings with clients

This case is a bit different than the previous one, but the result is the same (for the team). In both cases, the team does not have the support of their product owner, making the task of developing the right software difficult.

 

Solution:

The job of a product owner is not simple; it´s a tremendous and complex job, sometimes the product is so complex that one single person might not be able to manage everything.

I’ve seen some companies that brought business analysts to the team; these people took the responsibility of talking with clients to see what the market needs, leaving the responsibility of the technical product to the actual product owner. I saw this technique in several companies and it actually worked quite nicely.

The Product Owner Proxy

This person acts as a placeholder for the actual product owner. This can lead to delayed decisions or even conflicts. The author of Agile Product Management with Scrum, Roman Pichler, refers to a case where the PO was too busy to take the role, therefore a company got a proxy PO. At the end, there were various conflicts because the proxy PO was not empowered to make decisions and all decisions were supposed be made by the official PO who was never available.

Solution:

Each case is different, but as a general solution, I believe that we could try to use the same approach as in the first example. Having a business analyst within the team could help the product owner to get more time to help the team to deliver the right product.

Product owner community

This happens to companies that create a committee to be responsible for a product. When there is no one person responsible for the product, it can lead to delayed decisions. Often, most of the people involved want to reach an agreement between all parties, and this will lead to lengthy meetings without any proper outcome. This is a typical case of “too many chefs in the same kitchen”. This is quite similar to one of the problems that I raised above.

Solution:

Each product should have only one product owner. My experience tells me if we have too many people responsible for a product we have none. Never assign more than one product owner to a product. If you have several products that are connected with each other, you might need to have a program. In that case you should get a Program Manager or a Chief Product Owner as some companies call it, but never more than one person responsible for a product.

The Product Owner sacrifices the quality of the product in order to ship the product faster

I see this happening quite often, especially when a Product Owner is under external pressure. Stakeholders push Product Owners to release the product faster, even if the quality is not the best.

Of course, this approach will damage the company over the long term; everyone knows that poor quality software will sooner or later create problems and damage the provider’s reputation.

Solution:

This problem is quite serious and, in my opinion, is something that is part of the company´s culture (not caring about quality). The method I found most useful to reduce this problem is the presence of a Definition of Done (DoD).

A DoD is a simple list of tasks defined by the team that represents all the activities that must be done before a story goes into production. To find out more about this, check out this blog.

Without a DoD, it´s easier for the Product Owner to push the team to cut corners; if this list is there, on the other hand, it´s possible for developers to show that a story is not done until all tasks that are part of the DoD are completed. My experience tells me this helps to reduce the problem.

Confusing the Product Owner role with the Scrum Master Role

I saw this happen many times in companies where Scrum Masters were passive for a week or two. In this situation, Product Owners lack the necessary support from the Scrum Master, and they start to take care of all the activities inside of the team. At some point, the Product Owner no longer knows what his own role is, and what the Scrum Master´s role is. This causes a lot of confusion and, worst of all, conflicts and mistrust between the Product Owner and Scrum Master.

Solution:

The solution here is quite simple, but not easy to implement at all. In this case it is extremely important to get an experienced and strong Scrum Master. Great Scrum Masters are able to do their jobs in a well, but even more importantly, they are able to coach others in their own jobs. Great Scrum Masters are great coaches as well, so having a strong and competent Scrum Master in this situation is fundamental to improving these issues.

The Product Owner who expects a stretched commitment because "based on their experience it shouldn't take that long.”

It is quite common to see this behaviour from old school project managers, where commitments were almost forced by project managers or stakeholders. Another possible cause lies in the fact that Product Owners are ex tech leads or architects. In this situation, the team is dealing with someone who has great technical skills and who expects the team to solve the issues in a faster way.

Solution:

In both situations the Scrum Master’s job is quite important; he must protect the team. He must explain to the Product Owner that the team owns their estimates. They are the ones deciding how much it takes to deliver that amount of work and there is not much he can do. The Scrum Master must explain to the product owner that the team’s members are doing their best and he needs to trust them.

Being Product Owner because they're a department lead/manager. 

In some companies the Product Owner role has some semblance of power, and many people will try to grab this position even if they do not have any interest in the product itself. They use this position as a platform to increase their political power. As you can imagine, most of the time the outcome of this is poor and lacking in quality, driving everyone to frustration.

Solution:

In this case I truly believe there is not much that I can suggest; management must understand that a Product Owner is extremely important for the company and only people who understand customers and the market can do a good job. Assigning people to these positions who do not understand the market or the customers is a recipe for disaster. I can only suggest that management assign people based on quality and not based on political interest.

The Product Owner who feels it is not their role to maintain the backlog or delegates all of the actual User Story writing to the team and/or SM

I did not see this happening too often (fortunately) during my career, but it does happen. This type of Product Owner thinks his or her job is just to dump ideas into the backlog and that someone else should be doing the boring job of transforming the ideas into stories. This kind of Product Owner thinks that his job is too important to be spent on secondary tasks.

Solution:

I believe the Scrum Master and the team itself have an important role here. Together they must explain to the product owner that the aforementioned is his job. They must explain that without a proper backlog the team cannot do their jobs. The stories should be discussed between the Product Owner and the team. The product owner is the person ultimately responsible for keeping the product backlog in a good shape.

The scrum master and the team must show to the product owner that it is extremely difficult to do any kind of work if the product backlog is not maintained. A good story must be clear, optimally written in the INVEST (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Scalable and Testable) format with proper Acceptance Criteria.

The Product Owner who thinks a Scrum Master is just a project manager whose role is to pester people into doing their job

Sadly, there are still a lot of people do not understand anything about human behaviour. There are a lot of people who still think that punishments and pressure work quite nicely to motivate people. A lot of these Product Owners still believe that people are lazy and need project managers to keep them in line, and of course the Scrum Master fits perfectly into this job (according to their point of view).

Solution:

The solution here is not easy to achieve at all. I truly believe this has more to do with mindset than with any agile process. I would suggest taking this product owner to a good agile training session to make sure that he understands what the roles are in Agile software development.

To complement this, I would take him to a good training session about intrinsic motivators to help him understand what really drives people to do a great job. If he would not like to attend any of these training sessions, maybe give him the book Drive by Daniel Pink. Hopefully he will then understand that punishment or pressure will never motivate people.

The Product Owner who refuses to choose between five top priorities 

I see this quite often; the Product Owner calls the most important story a Must, then there appears another story he says is more important, they become a Must-Must story, and so on. This clearly shows that the Product Owner really does not understand what the single most important thing that must be achieved during the next sprint is.

Having the teams working on several important issues is a really dangerous factor. Not too long ago, some of my teams were working on different goals to be achieved in a single sprint. The result was poor, there was no focus, and while everyone worked on everything, the teams constantly failed to achieve their goals.

Solution:

Here it is quite important for the Product Owner to understand what the most important things are that must be delivered to the customers. Product Owners must understand the team cannot deliver everything at the same time, so they really must understand what is the top priority that should be achieved during the next sprint.

When we applied this rule in some of my teams, teams got extremely focused and they started to deliver much more stories per sprint. But more important than that, they started to deliver fully implemented features that could be shipped to the customer. Before, the teams were delivering a lot of things, but none of their features were ready, blocking the release to the customers.

The Product Owner who insists on architecting the solution design

I mentioned above that sometimes the Product Owner is an ex architect or an ex tech leader. As a result, it’s normal to have these kind of anti patterns. The Product Owner wants to be responsible for the architecture of the product, driving the team crazy.

Solution:

The Scrum Master and the team must explain to the Product Owner that the design of architecture is not his responsibility. I always like to give this explanation: The Scrum Master and the team are responsible for “How”: How the product is made. The Product Owner is responsible for the “What” part, meaning that the Product Owner should be the one saying what is supposed to be built.

The Product Owner who does not regard himself as a team member

I do not see this anti pattern too often, but several people have mentioned it to me, therefore I am adding it into my list. As the name suggests, the Product Owner does not feel himself part of the team. He feels that he should only be responsible for delivering the stories and nothing more. As you can imagine, the cooperation between the team members and Product Owners will not be the best, and at some point the collaboration will become extremely hard.

Solution:

The Scrum Guide says:

“The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master.”

Just because the Scrum Guide says that, of course, there is no guarantee the Product Owner will consider himself part of the team—But, I think this could be a good start nevertheless. The Scrum Master or the team could explain to him that, according to the manual, the Product Owner is officially part of the team. On top of this argument, the team and Scrum Master could explain to the Product Owner they are not able to do a fantastic job unless the Product Owner starts to becomes more connected to them. This could be a nice topic for one of the Retrospectives.

Hope you liked it :) During the next weeks I will write much more about these topics :)
