Money in 3X

Part of [Comparing Explore, Expand, and Extract](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/comparing-explore-expand-and-extract-topics-in-3x/1241983035834558).

One euro during exploration. One euro during expansion. One euro during extraction. In an accounting ledger they all look identical. Interpreting, collecting, distributing, budgeting and conserving money changes by phase. A euro spent in exploration is one of a precious few. That same euro spent in expansion is irrelevant as long as it reduces risks to growth. In extraction, that euro comes out of profit.

The risk comes in not recognizing transitions between phases. A team proud of its ability to experiment cheaply puts itself at risk during expansion unless it can get used to spending money to reduce risk. A team used to trading off money for risk can’t extract full value when the risks no longer drive development.

## Explore

Money is a limited resource, along with time and people, during exploration. Partly this is to encourage portfolio effects. Limiting spending on any one idea funds other ideas. Limited budgets also encourage efficient experimentation.

Depend upon it, sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.  
_Boswell: Life_

Startup mythology is full of stories of diminishing bank accounts, one last roll of the dice, dramatic pivots, and sudden success after months or years of fruitless search. (All the stories that end in failure don’t enter the canon.)

A euro spent means one less chance at success. It means one less day until failure. And yet it must be spent. “Ships in the harbor are safe, but that’s not what ships are built for.” Exploration is the search for a connection between success and payoff.

A euro earned during exploration is primarily information, not money. You can’t earn enough during exploration to significantly extend your runway. A euro earned is a prophecy of more to come. Potential investors will pay for more runway if the prophecy is compelling.

Income is a distraction if your goal is huge network effects with small revenue per user. If the ability to charge for your service is a risk, as in enterprise software, then income is critical early information. In either case, though, the absolute amounts are irrelevant. Investors will provide the money to survive expansion (or early users will provide capital if you are bootstrapping).

## Expand

Once the rocket is lit, money changes character. The risks are:

- Rapid unscheduled disassembly in flight. Think of Friendster, growing like mad but unable to maintain performance and stability. They could have beaten Facebook but instead they blew up in flight.
- Not reaching altitude. Competition and changing tastes can truncate growth. Once the rocket is lit, take it as high as you can. “How much faster could you grow with more capital?”

Capital goes from being scarce to being abundant when you enter expansion.

One failure is continuing to experiment. After all, during exploration you had to abandon many experiments in favor of the experiments you actually ran. You didn’t have the money to run them then. You do now.

If you continue to spread your bets all over the table, though, you won’t see or address your bottlenecks. Attention is still a limited resource even if money isn’t, and all of your attention needs to be addressed to your next bottleneck.

Another failure is to start spend like you’re in extraction–nice offices, big parties, that Super Bowl ad. It makes sense to want nice things. You’ve just gone through a time of penury. You haven’t won yet, though. That second-hand Aeron will do for a while yet. Spending to collect everyone in one office instead of scattered all over makes sense, because that reduces risk. Marble bathrooms, not so much.

One problem of money in the switch to expansion is that the absolute numbers change so much. Where once you were worried about tens of thousands, now you’re worried about millions. Spending a little here and a little there doesn’t seem like it should make that much difference. It’s not the money, it’s the attention that goes with it.

Not all bottlenecks can be outspent. Sometimes you have to (temporarily?) suspend expensive features that aren’t vital to growth. One way to think about this is, “What is the least product that is still compelling?”

## Extract

Extraction is where money finally starts to act like money. Profit equals revenue minus expenses. Increase revenue. Decrease expenses. Accelerate revenue. Defer expenses.

Value in exploration and expansion is driven by option value. You are making promises and investors value those promises. In extraction, value is driven by cash flows. Growth is 2x, 3x, 5x and based on history, not 1000x and served on a bed of story and optimism.

The absolute numbers have change yet again, two orders of magnitude higher than they were expansion. You need to either adjust to the amounts or hire people who are not intimidated by all those zeros.

Extraction money is a shorter lever. You might spend a hundred million euros to earn ten million, not spend a million to unlock ten million in growth as you did in expansion.

## Conclusion

_Money across the phases in one picture_

This picture summarizes how money changes across the phases. I’ve left the “capital in extraction” blank because I don’t understand it well enough to summarize it at the same level as the rest of the cells. If someone is willing to tutor me, I’d appreciate it.
