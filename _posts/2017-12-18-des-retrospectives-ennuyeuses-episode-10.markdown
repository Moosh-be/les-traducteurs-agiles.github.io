It’s **hard to come up with new retrospective exercises** as a facilitator.  However, I believe keeping it fresh helps the team to boost their continuous improvement results.

In my previous ‘[boring retrospective](https://skycoach.be/category/continuous-improvement/)’ posts I introduced a number of new retrospective exercises you can use, depending of the state of your team and project.

Today’s exercise is called ‘**Walk the board**’.  I have done it several times with different teams and it led to some amazing insights and improvements.

It is ideal for teams who have done a couple of sprints and struggle to deliver their sprint backlog.

Here’s how it goes:

1. Invite the team to **gather around the task board**.  You might want to pull out some chairs, this is not a standup J

2. **Explain the purpose** of the exercise: “__Let’s reconstruct the history of each user story.  Together we will try to tell what happened, when somebody started to work on it, which difficulties popped up, when it was tested, why it was on hold, etc…__”

Explain the team that our goal is to find patterns which help us to understand where our process flow is obstructed.  In other words, where our biggest bottleneck lies.  If we can understand it, we can think about improvements to reduce or remove it.  This way, fewer user stories will be stuck in the process and our chance of delivering what we planned increases.

3. I always **start with a user story** that is only recently finished.  This is easier because it is still fresh in mind.

Ask questions as a facilitor and help the team to think what happened to the user story in each step of the process.  When the story is told, agree with the team on the major bottleneck of this user story.  Write it on a post-it and put it on the user story.  Continue with a next user story and so on.

4. When you’ve done a handful of user stories, move to the second part of the exercise, which is **exploring patterns**.

As a group, look at the ‘bottleneck’ post-its which you put on the user stories and discuss if there’s a pattern.  In most cases there will be a pattern, which you can use for the last part of the exercise, which is thinking about improvements.

5.  As a group **think of actions** you can take to reduce or eliminate the bottleneck.

It’s a simple excercise, with very little preparation and high interaction.  Depending on the knowlegde of the team, it might be appropriate to do an introduction of the [theory of constraints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints) first.
