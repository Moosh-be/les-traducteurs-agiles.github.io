Economy in 3X

Part of [Comparing Explore, Expand, and Extract](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/comparing-explore-expand-and-extract-topics-in-3x/1241983035834558).

There’s always something to economize. As with all the other topics discussed in this series of essays, phases change _what_ is economized.

What do I mean when I say “economize”? Different changes, activities, and resources are cheap in different phases, and different changes, activities, and resources are expensive in different phases. Those changes, activities, and resources that are both rare and valuable in a phase are worth economizing. Tracking usage creates value. Finding ways to use less of them for the same effect creates value. That’s what I mean by “economize”–making more of rare, valuable resources available.

## Explore

I’ve mentioned the trio of people/time/money several times in these essays. They are all worth economizing. If you can perform the same experiment with half the people/time/money, you paid for another experiment.

Taking a step back, exploration values Economy of Scope. Exploration is the asking and answering of questions. The less you can do to find a juicy question and the less you can do to answer it, the more expected value you create in exploration. Each question is a roll of the dice. Each is worth the same before it is asked.

Sometimes Economy of Scope results from a tradeoff. Careful analysis can extract the same confidence from less data. A lower fidelity implementation can elicit the same behavior. Relaxing standards for the quality of an early answer can lead to a quicker answer.

False Economy of Scope is when you do less work, get a significantly worse answer, but ignore the difference. When I’ve done this, it’s usually because I’m so damn proud of the cleverness of my shortcut, like the time I posted a link to a poker-related game on Twitter and was thrilled by the uptake. Turns out that whether programmers will try a poker-related game once is a poor predictor of whether poker players will play it repeatedly for money. False answers leads to waste downstream. I had to spend more scope before realizing my game had no future.

## Expand

In expansion, you’re a mortal lock on some kind of success, even if you may not know how high the rocket is going to go. The failures are failure to eliminate the bottlenecks to scaling, and failure to fully realize the potential of expansion. What’s in short supply is safety. Expansion’s game is the Economy of Safety.

Expansion is driving a foggy road at night. Obstacles appear suddenly out of the mist. The driver’s job is not to hit the obstacle but, more than that, to swerve in such a way that the car is prepared to avoid the next obstacle too. A swerve that leaves the car sliding sideways is merely failure deferred. This is Economy of Safety, using only as much of the safety margin as necessary on a given obstacle.

In the computer world, you can waste safety by too much and too little reaction. If you approach a bottleneck and do the absolute minimum necessary to defer it, then you are likely to hit it again. Even if you don’t, pasting an ad hoc solution on an ad hoc solution eventually results in rigidity.

Curiously, the opposite is also true. Be preparing up front for every conceivable bottleneck you make the system rigid with respect to the inconceivable bottlenecks.

## Extract

It seems strange to talk about economizing when discussing products deep in the extract phase. The money is flowing. Time is predictable. You can plan with some expectation that the plans will come true. However, there’s a big difference between “clearly could be a winner” and “winner”. In extraction you need Economy of Scale.

All the custom, one-off solutions that made sense when exploring and expanding are now magnified by the scale of your success. Costs are magnified and so is lost revenue. Mean time to repair becomes an important metric.

Functional organizations, layer organizations (like “infrastructure” versus “product”), consolidating similar systems, standardizing hardware, and longer planning cycles all make sense during extraction.

## Conclusion

Economy is necessary at every stage, but what is economized changes:

- Explore–economy of scope, where more is learned by expending fewer resources
- Expand–economy of safety, where bottlenecks are avoided with just enough effort to leave the system and team in a good state to address the next bottleneck
- Extract–economy of scale, where profit is optimized by reducing scalable costs
