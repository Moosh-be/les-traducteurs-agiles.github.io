Teams in 3X

Part of [Comparing Explore, Expand, and Extract](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/comparing-explore-expand-and-extract-topics-in-3x/1241983035834558).

Functional organization? Cross-functional? Matrix? Tiger teams? Skunkworks? As with all the topics addressed in these notes, the answer here is “depends on phase”.

_Worst case scenario_

Person-to-person connections power organizations. But which person to which person? As with the resources on a project, connections are subject to opportunity costs. If we lunch, I can’t be lunching with someone else. If we sit next to each other, I can’t sit next to someone else. Some connections are more valuable than others.

Further, the value of connections change over time but people, being people, tend to prefer stable connections. (And by “people”, I mean “I”.) What would have been valuable connection at one stage of a project or one stage of a career, is no longer the most valuable connection.

I am not going to give personal advice on connecting with other people, which you can thank me for later, but I will point out ways that personal connections change value as a product grows through the three phases.

One caveat: a certain amount of randomness in personal connections is always valuable. Always have sources of orthogonal connections in your life–church, sports club, choir, dancing lessons, neighbors.

## Explore

The goal in exploration is to have as many informative experiments as possible in a given span of time/money/people. The experiments should be as uncorrelated as possible, to ensure you’ve covered as many of the possibilities as possible.

The team as a whole can be large, but experiments should be performed by small, cross-functional pods. Two, three, four people is good. You can also have a part of the team devoted to increasing the pace of experimentation, but create it from experienced experimenters and get them back to experimenting once they have improved the latency of experiments.

Beyond a common vision, focus hinders exploration teams. Time spent collaborating or coordinating can be better spent experimenting. Meet as a whole to communicate important discoveries, to review dwindling resources, or to decide on the shift to expansion.

Competition between experimental pods is a source of emotional energy. As long as competition doesn’t go so far as to hinder other pods, encourage it. I remember being in a mock trial of Lt. William Calley in high school. Our defense team and the opposing prosecuting team challenged each other to greater heights of focus and intensity. Which was fine until we figured out we could check out _all_ the Vietnam War books from _all_ the surrounding public libraries. That was too far.

## Expand

Once a winner has picked you, bottlenecks will appear during growth. The greater the opportunity, the harder it will be to keep the supply and demand beams from crossing. The most valuable social connections become those that encourage spotting coming bottlenecks and addressing them. Form teams around bottlenecks.

_Dealing with a bottleneck just in time_

Expansion is where the war room or what we call “lockdown” at Facebook becomes valuable. Coordination, until now unwelcome overhead, becomes critical. Getting the whole bottleneck team in one room and temporarily removing distractions encourages new social connections concentrated on a single problem.

## Extract

Economies of scale deliver value during extraction. Duplication of effort that was only vaguely annoying during exploration starts costing real money at scale. Maintaining the patches and bandaids that got the team through expansion likewise becomes a major expense.

Functional teams are best suited to reduce costs through economies of scale. Separation into layers, common infrastructure versus product, encourages further economies of scale.

Functional teams necessarily misalign incentives \[love to find a way to fix this\]. One team’s gains may involve another team’s loss. Management is responsible for communicating the overall vision and ensuring that teams optimize instead of maximize or minimize.

## Conclusion

Some time during extraction, the organization needs to spawn a new set of explorations. These explorations require teams of autonomous pods. And so the cycle continues: autonomous pods exploring ideas to a single unified team surviving a sequence of bottlenecks to functional teams delivering economies of scale to autonomous pods.

Or you can just try them all at once and end up with folks working just hard enough not to get fired. That’s not good for anyone.
